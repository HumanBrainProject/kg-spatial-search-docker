# Run the init-hbp-solr-home script and source any '.sh' scripts that are found
# in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`. Files there will be executed in alphabetical
# order.
#
# This script (run-initdb) is sourced by some of the solr-* commands, so that
# I can run eg:
#
#   mkdir initdb; echo "echo hi" > initdb/hi.sh
#   docker run -v $PWD/initdb:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d hbp-lucene-solr
#
# and have your script execute before hbp-lucene-solr instance starts.
#
# Note: scripts can modify the environment, which will affect subsequent scripts
# and ultimately Solr. That allows you to set environment variables from your 
# scripts (though you usually just use "docker run -e"). If this is undesirable
# in your use-case, have your scripts execute a sub-shell.

set -e

# init script for handling a custom SOLR_HOME

# execute files in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d before starting hbp-lucene-solr
